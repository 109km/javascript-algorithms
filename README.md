* bubble sort
* heap sort

* selection sort
* shell sort

## Leetcode

Some solutions of leetcode's problems.

## Data structure

Data structures implemented in Javascript.

* stack
* queue
* singlely linked list
* doublely linked list
* tree

## Questions from 《IT-Interview》

### Stack & queue

* Stack with `getMin` and `reverse`
* Stack with `sort` implemented by another stack
* Queue of dogs and cats
* Hanoi Tower with order implemented by recursion
* Hanoi Tower with order implemented by stack
* Get max numbers in the `window` of an array
* Get the max area of a matrix
* Get number of sub-arraies which suits the equation: `max - min <= num`

### Linked list
* Print the common part of two ordered linked list
* Remove the `nth` node from tail
* Remove the node at the position of `a/b`
* Reverse the linked list
* Reverse part of the linked list
* Remove nodes of a cyclic linked list until one node left
* Check a linked list is palindrome or not
* Sort the linked list by the prviot
* Copy the linked list with a `rand` pointer
* Add two int linked list together
* Find the first crossing node of two linked lists.
